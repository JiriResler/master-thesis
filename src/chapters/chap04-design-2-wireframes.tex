Figure x contains a mockup of the guest profile editor application.
The user selects what allergens they want to avoid in their food.
Then they can choose from some of the most popular diets which they follow.
After that they can specify what food ingredients they like and dislike by writing their name to the corresponding input field and clicking the "Add" button.
When the user is finished with creating their profile, they click the "Save" button at the bottom of the screen to save their profile.
