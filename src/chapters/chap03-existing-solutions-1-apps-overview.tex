\subsection*{Allergen Checker}
  Allergen Checker (link in footnote) is an allergen management software which enables a restaurant employee to add allergen information to a menu.
  
  A menu is created in three steps.
  In the first step, the restaurant employee creates ingredients which are then stored in a database called the restaurant's "virtual food cupboard".
  During the second step, the restaurant employee creates dishes by specifying their ingredients.
  In the third step, the restaurant employee creates a menu by specifying its dishes.
  
  The application provides a pre-defined list of basic ingredients in its database.
  An ingredient has information about what allergen it contains and also what allergens it may contain. 
  The restaurant employee can also copy information from the ingredient's packaging which will be then displayed in a dish's description in the menu.
  
  Allergen Checker allows for categorizing of dishes and menus. 
  Categories are thought of as a file system for dishes and menus.
  This is convenient when the restaurant employee needs to search for a specific menu or dish.
