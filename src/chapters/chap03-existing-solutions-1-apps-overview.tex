\subsection*{Allergy Menu}
  Allergy menu allows a restaurant employee to maintain a mobile accessible and up-to-date menu that customers can tailor to their food preferences.
  
  A restaurant employee first creates a new menu and adds categories to it, e.g. "Starters" or "Desserts".
  Dishes are then added to each category of the menu.
  A dish contains allergen information as well as flags whether it is suitable for vegans and vegetarians.
  The restaurant employee can also add calories to the dish.

  When a restaurant employee wants to change something in a dish, they can create a copy of the dish which is hidden on the published menu.
  After they finish changes, the dish can be marked as "live", making it appear on the menu with updated content. 

  A dish can optionally contain internal notes, with the ability to upload photographs of products used within the dish.
  The application sends and e-mail regularly to review a menu with all the allergy information.
  An existing menu can be imported to the application in the CSV format.
  Allergy Menu provides an API for food suppliers, allowing them to sync menu information directly into the application without manual intervention.
  
  A guest can interact with a published menu by choosing what allergens they want to avoid.
  The application then filters out items of the menu to meet the guest's preferences.
  A guest can also select an option that they are either a vegan or vegetarian.
  
  A unique restaurant code is used to identify restaurants. 
  This is what guests enter into the application when they want to browse a menu.
  A guest can also find a restaurant which uses Allergy Menu on a map.

\subsection*{Allergen Checker}
  Allergen Checker is an allergen management software which enables a restaurant employee to add allergen information to a menu.
  
  A menu is created in three steps.
  In the first step, the restaurant employee creates ingredients which are then stored in a database called the restaurant's "virtual food cupboard".
  During the second step, the restaurant employee creates dishes by specifying their ingredients.
  In the third step, the restaurant employee creates a menu by specifying its dishes.
  
  The application provides a pre-defined list of basic ingredients in its database.
  An ingredient has information about what allergen it contains and also what allergens it may contain. 
  The restaurant employee can also copy information from the ingredient's packaging which will be then displayed in a dish's description in the menu.
  
  Allergen Checker allows for categorizing of dishes and menus. 
  Categories are thought of as a file system for dishes and menus.
  This is convenient when the restaurant employee needs to search for a specific menu or dish.

  Items of a menu are shown in three groups.
  There are items which are "Okay to eat", items which are "Okay to eat with modifications" and items which are "Not okay to eat".
  Items and ingredients which are not okay to eat are clearly marked in the item's detail.
  
  The application also supports online ordering of meals.
  The guest can select what they want to eat and choose different ingredients.
  The Eagle platform tries to recommend to the guest what they might want to order using a sort of artificial intelligence algorithm.
  The application also displays detailed nutritional information for the current state of the order and shows whether the guest's nutritional goals are met.

  The consumer-facing website sends analytical data to the backend portal application, which is the other part of the Eagle platform.
  It serves for restaurants to manage their online menus and see insights on how their customers are using the guest application.
  The portal allows creating multi-location menus to show a different menu based on the restaurant's location.
  The restaurant employee can set up menu groups, categories and individual food items.
  A menu item can be disabled for a certain category, group or restaurant location.
  Creating a menu item involves adding all choices and their variations.
  A restaurant employee can manually create restaurant ingredients or choose from a pre-defined list of ingredients.
