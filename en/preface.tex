Health is the most important thing we have in our lives.
If we want to be healthy, we need to, among other things, think about what we eat.
People today are trying various diets in order to stay in shape and feel good.
There are also many people with food allergies who need to pick carefully what they eat, as some food is harmful for them. 
If a person who is on a diet or has an allergy decides to visit a restaurant which they have never been to, they spend a lot of time reading the restaurant's menu. 
They need to browse it in order to find a meal which is healthy for them to eat, which means that the meal has to correspond to their diets and allergies.
In this thesis we will document the process of the creation of a web application whose purpose will be to help these people to be able to quickly choose what they want to eat at a restaurant. 
The application will achieve this by letting its users create their personal profile and within it to specify what allergies they have or what diets they are on. 
It will also enable restaurant providers to create menus online so that the visitors can view them before coming to the restaurant.
When a visitor will browse a restaurant's menu, the application will read information from the visitor's profile and only display meals which the visitor is able to eat according to their diets and allergies.
